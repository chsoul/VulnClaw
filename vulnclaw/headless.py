"""Headless / non-interactive scan support.

This module owns the three things a CI operator needs and nothing else:

- **Scan-mode presets** (``quick``/``standard``/``deep``) — named bundles of the
  existing effort knobs (``solve_max_steps``/legacy ``solve_max_directions``/
  legacy ``solve_max_tool_rounds``/``max_rounds``) plus the fan-out cap
  (``solve_max_parallel``). Legacy fields are retained for compatibility and
  mode scaling; the default model-led solve no longer performs direction
  planning. Presets seed from today's ``config.session`` values so a user who
  tuned their config keeps that tuning in ``standard``; ``quick`` and ``deep``
  scale it down/up. Explicit CLI flags override the preset.
- **The exit-code contract** — ``run --non-interactive`` maps the resulting
  finding set onto a distinct exit code so a pipeline can tell a clean scan
  from a broken one from one that confirmed a real vulnerability.
- **Run artifacts** — a machine-readable ``summary.json`` written into the run
  directory so downstream CI steps have structured output to consume.

Deliberately provider/engine-agnostic and free of Typer/Rich imports: the CLI
`run` command drives it today, and keeping it dependency-free keeps it trivially
unit-testable (and reusable if the Web layer ever needs the same contract).
