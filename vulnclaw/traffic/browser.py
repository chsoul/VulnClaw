"""Headless Playwright browser routed through the shared capture layer.

The browser is a VulnClaw-maintained headless Playwright instance inside the
sandbox, launched with the run's mitmproxy as its upstream proxy so that
browser-driven and direct-HTTP traffic land in one store. chrome-devtools MCP
stays an optional overlay (normalized via ``normalize``).

``playwright`` is an optional dependency — importing this module never requires
it. The request/response mapping (:func:`exchange_from_playwright`) is
transport-agnostic and unit-testable against stub objects; the launch helper is
gated behind :func:`playwright_available`.
