"""Data model for the VulnClaw-owned traffic evidence store.

These dataclasses describe HTTP exchanges independently of *how* they were
captured (mitmproxy proxy, headless Playwright, or an overlay MCP server such as
Burp / chrome-devtools). The capture layer normalizes every backend into a
:class:`CapturedExchange`, so the store and the agent-facing tools only ever
speak this one shape.
