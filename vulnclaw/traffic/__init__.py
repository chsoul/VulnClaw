"""VulnClaw-owned, sandbox-native HTTP traffic evidence store.

A single capture layer (mitmproxy addon + headless Playwright, plus optional
Burp / chrome-devtools overlays) writes every in-scope request/response to an
append-only JSONL index plus raw blob files under ``evidence/traffic/``.
Findings reference a captured pair by ``request_id``; the report generator
inlines the raw request/response that proved each verified finding.
